    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    <h2>September-October 2022</h2>
    <p>Before any of this, I had extremely limited knowledge about coding. All I knew was that you could type</p><br>
  <blockquote>print("hello world")</blockquote><br><p>into something and it would print "hello world". So for my MYP Personal Project Class this year, I decided that I would learn how to code. I knew that I wanted to learn Python specifically, because my friends and classmates who already have experience said that Python was the easiest language to learn because of its' syntax.<br><br> Since Personal Project was an actual class that would grade your stuff off rubrics, I had to be more methodical in my process than if I was doing this learning project at home. For example, I made a Google Drive and researched things like different coding languages, where to learn coding, how to practice it, etc. One of the biggest parts of my research was trying to figure out which resource to use. I had narrowed it down to 4 online resources and 1 physical book. </p>

    <h3>November 2022 - January 2023</h3>
    <p>I had originally planned to use three different resources to learn Python:</p>
    <ul><br>
      <li>Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart 
        (ebook)</li>
      <li>Free Code Camp (online course)</li>
      <li>Python Crash Course by  Eric Matthes (book)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><br>There was an important change in my learning process around the end of November. I realized that I did not need to jump back and forth between three courses just to learn Python. It wasn't realistic to be able to finish three courses with my current schedule anyways. I stuck to Automate the Boring Stuff because unlike FreeCodeCamp, I could read at my own pace rather than watch videos. Unlike PythonCrashCourse, I could learn Python at school since Automate was an ebook I could take everywhere.</p>
