  <p>Hello! My name is Cinya, and I'm a sophomore at ISB. This website is made to  talk about my coding journey and display the skills I have learned. I chose 
  learning how to code, focusing primarily in Python, for my MYP Personal Project. MYP Personal Project is one of the requirements for getting my MYP diploma so that next year (11th grade) I can move into the IB diploma program!

  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p>In my personal project plan, there were four phases of the project: initial research, Python research, website development research, and website creation. I started learning HTML and CSS in the website development phase. Compared to the way I learned Python, my web development learning was a lot more chaotic. Learning Python was very methodical, as I followed a Python course. However, rather than taking a complete course on HTML or CSS, I learned bits and pieces of it as I needed it for my website. For example, if I needed to learn how to center text, I would learn it on the spot rather than going through an entire course on CSS.</p>
<p>My process for actually creating this website involved a lot of going back and forth between sources. First, I would code the entire website on Replit, because it showed the review immediately. I would have to search for HTML elements and CSS decorations while simultaneously coding.  After that, I would copy the code and files onto Github, because Github took longer to update new code implementations, but was an optimal place to host a website for free.
