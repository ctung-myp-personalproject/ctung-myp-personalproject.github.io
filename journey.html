 <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
 <h2>September-October 2022</h2>
 <p>Before any of this, I had extremely limited knowledge about coding. All I knew was that you could type</p>
 <blockquote>print("hello world")</blockquote><br><p>into something and it would print "hello world". So for my MYP Personal Project Class this year, I decided that I would learn how to code. I knew that I wanted to learn Python specifically, because my friends and classmates who already have experience said that Python was the easiest language to learn because of its' syntax. <br><blockquote>My official learning goal for this class was to learn Python. My product goal is this website, where I will present my learning process.</blockquote><br><br> Since Personal Project was an actual class that would grade your stuff off rubrics, I had to be more methodical in my process than if I was doing this learning project at home. For example, I made a Google Drive and researched things like different coding languages, where to learn coding, how to practice it, etc. One of the biggest parts of my research was trying to figure out which resource to use. I had narrowed it down to 4 online resources and 1 physical book. </p>

 <h3>November 2022 - January 2023</h3>
 <p>I had originally planned to use three different resources to learn Python:</p>
 <ul><br>
 <li>Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart 
(ebook)</li>
 <li>Free Code Camp (online course)</li>
 <li>Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes (book)</li>
 </ul>
 
    <p><br>There was an important change in my learning process around the end of November. I realized that I did not need to jump back and forth between three courses just to learn Python. It wasn't realistic to be able to finish three courses with my current schedule anyways. I stuck to Automate the Boring Stuff because unlike FreeCodeCamp, I could read at my own pace rather than watch videos. Unlike PythonCrashCourse, I could learn Python at school since Automate was an ebook I could take everywhere.</p>
<p>After that, all I had to do was to finish the Automate the Boring Stuff chapters. The book went over stuff like syntax, basic functions, flow control, etc. I made it up unti around Chapter 7 out of 20 chapters until I realized that I would realisitcally not be able to finish this book in time. Back in November, I expected that I would be able to finish this book within around 2 months. But after only getting through 5 chapters in one month, I decided I need to use my judgement and pick/choose which chapters have fundamental information that I NEED to know. So, I stopped my "learning" part of my personal project after finishing Chapter 10. This was because the chapters beyond Chapter 10 had extra information that weren't super fundamental for me to know, like how to apply Python to multiple spreadsheet programs. I decided I got the general gist of Python and had enough knowledge to create simple programs, so I decided to move onto the product goal part of personal project, or creating this website.</p><p><br> Note: My sample Python projects can be accessed through these buttons below. The code can be seen by pressing the "main.py" tab.</p>

 <h4>January-Febuary 2023</h4>
 <p>Even though my learning goal was to specifically learn Python, I still knew that my product goal would require me to learn additional languages. I knew this doesn't fit my learning goal specifically, I stlil knew that I wanted to be more extra so I can have a better overview of coding languages in general. My process of learning HTML and CSS was less "formal" than following the ebook for learning Python. I created my website as I learned, rather than learning and then creating. For example, I wrote these paragraphs as I was writing the code for this subpage.</p>
<div class="drive">

<p>Questionable beginning of my website...</p>
</div>
   <p>First, I learned the  basics of HTML off of W3schools, a website with coding guides. W3schools was less of a course, and more like teaching you what you need to know individually, when you need it. For example, if I needed to learn how to change the color of text, I would look for it on w3schools rather than go through an entire unit on CSS styling. I also used Youtube as a resource, such as when I needed to create the menu bar. Although some might argue I was just following a tutorial and didn't use my knowledge, I think that I still learned a lot of information from these "tutorials" that I could apply to my future projects. My process for creating this website was definately a lot more chaotic, especially with the deadline coming up, but I still think that I learned a lot from creating this website </p>
   <h5>Reflection on Coding as a Career</h5>
   <p>One of my motivations for choosing to learn Python was to see if I would be suited for doing computer science as a career. Based off of how coding languages is learned with these courses, I don't think I would enjoy becoming a software developer. I think I will continue learning Python because of how easy it can make things, and how it can "automate" the tasks you don't want to do. It's very satisfying to see your program work it's magic so quickly after all your hard work. However, the process of coming up with new software is what I don't neccesarily like. You have to identify a problem and figure out how to solve it with code, but the amount of information you have to pull in is so much that it becomes overwhelming. I also don't like how I have to learn Python asynchronously. Sometimes the information I learn in these online Python courses goes in one ear and out the other, I can never seem to remember the information. Also, trying to debug your program is very annoying to me. How detail oriented you need to be makes my head hurts sometimes. Personally, I also don't think I would enjoy sitting in front of a computer all day, trying to get your program to work when I could do something hands on. </p>
   <p>I actually liked the process of creating my final product with HTML and CSS more than learning Python. This is because you could see the results right in front of you, there is a lot more gratification with visual results than back-end results. Even though I'm inclined towards STEM as a career, there is still a creativity and eye for aesthetic inside of me that I want to keep alive. If I had to have a career in computer science, I might be more suited to UX Design/front end development. </p>
